# FreeCodeCamp

This repository has all the solutions for the exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I will add to this as I go along the course. It is intended as a point of reference and to keep track of the practice that I'm doing.

## Directory Layout

Every directory is named after the section on FreeCodeCamp (for e.g. all exercises that come under the Bonfire section are in the bonfire folder).

All the sub-directories are named after the exercise name & number in that section.

Each sub-directory has:
  1. A README file that describes the problem & the tests that the code has to pass.
  2. The code itself in a .js file
