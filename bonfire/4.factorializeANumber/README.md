## Problem

Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120f

## Tests to Pass

- `expect(factorialize(5)).to.be.a("Number");`
- `expect(factorialize(5)).to.equal(120);`
- `expect(factorialize(10)).to.equal(3628800);`
- `expect(factorialize(20)).to.equal(2432902008176640000);`
